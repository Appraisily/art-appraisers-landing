# Art Appraiser Landing Page Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the improvements detailed in `improvements.md`. The goal is to transform our landing page to focus more heavily on "connecting with expert appraisers" rather than just the appraisal service itself, as our users are primarily searching for appraisers, not appraisals.

## Implementation Phases

We'll implement these changes in 4 phases over 4-6 weeks:

1. **Quick Wins** (Week 1)
2. **Content & Messaging Overhaul** (Weeks 1-2)
3. **UI & Component Updates** (Weeks 2-4)
4. **Advanced Features & Testing** (Weeks 4-6)
