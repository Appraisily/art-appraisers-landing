Below is a lean, prioritized action plan—complete with concrete copy-and-structure tweaks—to sharpen every section of your page around “finding an expert appraiser” and drive more visitors from lead to client.

1. Hero Section  
   • Headline tweak  
     – Change “Expert Art Appraisers You Can Trust”  
       to “Connect with Certified Art Appraisers Instantly.”  
   • Sub-headline  
     – Add a line under the H1:  
       “Specializing in fine art, antiques & collectibles—trusted by collectors worldwide.”  
   • Expert faces  
     – Make each face clickable (anchor-link down to their profile in the Experts section).  
   • Primary CTA  
     – Update button copy from “Get My Appraisal” to “Find My Expert Appraiser”  
     – Move a small “24-48h turnaround” badge next to it for urgency.  

2. Trust Bar  
   • Logo links  
     – Wrap each association logo in an external link to its website (open in a new tab).  
   • Guarantee bullets  
     – Combine into one line: “100% Satisfaction & Money-Back Guarantee.”  
     – Add a “Learn more” anchor that scrolls to the Trust Footer.  

3. “Why Choose Our Appraisers” Features  
   • Feature copy  
     - Replace “Certified Experts” description with:  
       “Hand-picked specialists, vetted by ISA & AAA for museum-grade appraisals.”  
     – Add a fifth tile: “Category Specialists” / “From Old Masters to Contemporary Works.”  
   • Visual cue  
     – Overlay a small “See Our Experts ↓” arrow that anchors to the Experts section.  

4. Process Steps  
   • Reframe steps in “appraiser” voice:  
     1. “Submit Your Artwork to Your Dedicated Appraiser”  
     2. “Our Experts Analyze & Authenticate”  
     3. “Appraiser Conducts Market Valuation”  
     4. “Receive Your Detailed Expert Report”  
   • CTA  
     – Change “Start Your Appraisal Now” to “Start with Your Appraiser”  

5. Merge & Simplify Value Sections  
   • Remove empty `ValueProposition`  
   • Combine `WhyChooseUs` into the main Features block or rename it “Our Service Advantages.”  
   • Pull any unique bullets (Security, Digital Ease, Reports) into a single 6-tile grid under “Why Choose Our Appraisers.”  

6. Recent Appraisals & Success Stories  
   • Concrete outcomes  
     – Prepend each case with “Appraiser: [Name]” so visitors connect examples to real people.  
     – Rotate 2–3 success stories every 10 seconds to surface different use-cases (insurance, estate, donation).  
   • Testimonial CTA  
     – Under each quote, add “Ask [Appraiser Name] How They Did It →” linking to a simple contact form.  

7. Services Grid  
   • Appraiser context  
     – For each card’s description, start with the expert angle:  
       e.g. “Our certified appraisers prepare IRS-compliant reports…”  
   • Secondary CTA  
     – After “Select This Service,” add “Not sure? Talk to an Appraiser” that opens a chat or booking widget.  

8. Experts Showcase  
   • Expand to 5–6 faces; add “See All Experts” button at the bottom.  
   • Dedicated profiles  
     – Turn `ExpertProfile` into dynamic pages or modals for *each* appraiser—link from both Hero and Experts grid.  
     – On each profile, include a personalized CTA: “Request an Appraisal from [Name].”  
   • Specializations  
     – Under titles, list 1–2 niche specialties (e.g. “Modern Sculpture & Ceramics”).  

9. Trust Footer  
   • Highlight key credentials first (“USPAP Compliant”, “IRS Qualified”) then affiliations.  
   • CTA  
     – Change “Start Now” to “Connect with Your Appraiser”  

10. Global tweaks & micro-optimizations  
    • Sticky header or “Jump to Counsel” ribbon that always offers “Speak to an Appraiser.”  
    • Exit-intent popup: “Leaving so soon? Chat with an Art Appraiser now ↓”  
    • A/B test button colors/text (e.g. “Find My Appraiser” vs. “Get Matched with an Expert”).  
    • Clear progress indicators or badges: “100% Appraiser-led Process,” “24h Response Guarantee.”  

By recasting every section in the voice of *your expert appraisers*, reinforcing personal connections (clickable faces, profile CTAs) and using more direct “appraiser-focused” language, you’ll make it crystal clear that you’re not just appraising art—you’re pairing every customer with a real certified professional.
